            The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses
            nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in
            memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the
            mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added
            subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in
            Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main
            architect of the Taj Mahal.

            The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal
            Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an
            older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex.The
            private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the
            Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity
            which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement.

            approximately 80 tons. The temple has a huge statue of Nandi (sacred bull) at the entrance. The statue is
            carved out of a single rock and weighs around 20 tons. The Lingam inside the temple is 3.7 meters tall.Due
            to the huge size of this temple, it is also called Dakshina Meru, i.e., southern mountain.A shrine and a
            pavilion to house a huge stone Nandi—Shiva's bull—were also added during the Nayakas period in the 17th
            century. The entire structure is made out of granite.

            causeway running across the pool.Situated facing the entrance to the causeway is the Akal Takht (“Throne of
            the Timeless One”), the chief center of authority of Sikhism and the headquarters of the Shiromani Akali Dal
            (Supreme Akali Party), the main political party of the Sikhs in Punjab.
